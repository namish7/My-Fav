            <p2> Some of my favorite hobbies are playing soccer, tennis, and playing video games. I play soccer almost everyday and my idols in soccer are Lionel Messi, Earling Haaland, Kiliyan Mbappe, and Cristiano Ronaldo. My favorite player is Lionel Messi. He has broken so many records including some of PELE's records. I also play tennis but I just started learning so I don't have any idols yet, but there is one person in my class who I really look up to. He has been learning for 6 years (he is stil learning) and his name is Cilis. I also like to play video games. I am a huge fan of The Legend Of Zelda. I am really waiting for the Legend Of Zelda Breath Of the Wild Sequal which comes out in 2022. but another Zelda game is coming out NEXT MONTH. It's called The Legend Of Zelda Skyward Sword. All these great games are by Nintendo! I also do musix and I play drums, Marimba (related to a xylophone), and Snare Drum!</p2>
