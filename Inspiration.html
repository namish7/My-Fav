    <p class="Messi_GOD_LIKE">When I was around 3 or 4, I started getting intrest in soccer. So whenever I got a device to watch something I would try to look up Messi. He is really an inspiration to me. He had to work from the ground up, and just because he was tiny/short. People would critisize him on alol of the time. For being short, for not talking at a press conf rence, or for making a mistake. ALL HUMANS MAKE MISTAKE BUT STILL HE WAS CRITISIZED!!!! But he didn't care. He made all the haters go quiet and thats why he is so inspirational to me:)</p>
